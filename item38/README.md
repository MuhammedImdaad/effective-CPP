### Model “has-a” or “is-implemented-in-terms-of” through composition
Composition means either “has-a” or “is-implemented-in-terms-of.” When composition occurs between objects in the application domain, it expresses a `has-a` relationship. When it occurs in the implementation domain, it expresses an `is-implemented-in-terms-of` relationship.
### Things to Remember
* Composition has meanings completely different from that of public inheritance.
* In the application domain, composition means has-a. In the implementation domain, it means is-implemented-in-terms-of.
