### Pay attention to compiler warnings
In C++, it's a good bet compiler writers have a better grasp of what's going on than you do. It's important to make sure that before you dismiss a warning, you understand exactly what it's trying to tell you. Recall that warnings are inherently implementation-dependent.
### Things to Remember
* Take compiler warnings seriously, and strive to compile warning-free at the maximum warning level supported by your compilers.

* Don't become dependent on compiler warnings, because different compilers warn about different things. Porting to a new compiler may eliminate warning messages you've come to rely on.
